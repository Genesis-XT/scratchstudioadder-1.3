# Scratch Studio Adder 1.3

## How to set this up
Note that in order to work, this repo needs your Scratch login data. If you don't want to add your login data, then just exit. It will also cause you to log off your own Scratch account on your PC every six hours.

## Fork
First, create a fork of this repository. For this, you need a github account.

## Set env secrets
After you have forked this repository, you need to go to Settings. Here you need to go to `Security -> Secrets and variables -> Actions`
Here, you need to click `New repository secret`
Put `USERNAME` in the Name field and your Scratch username in the Secret field. `Click Add secret`.
Repeat steps 2-3 for `PASSWORD` and your Scratch password.
Start the workflow to test it
Go to Actions. Click on Studio adder. `Click Run workflow -> Run workflow`. Go to your Scratch account web page. If you appear to have a lot of new activity and you are automatically logged off, then it works. Otherwise, contact me or `TheCommCraft` for help.

## End
After you have followed all the steps, your projects should automatically be added to a lot of popular Scratch studios. Side effects include: You WILL be logged off from your Scratch account very often. You might not be able to add projects to studios manually a lot of the time.

## Other Information
